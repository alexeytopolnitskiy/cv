## Introduction

This repo consists of different computer vision challenges that I set to myself to solve.

## Challenges

    * Task: obtain 85% accuracy on test data. 
    * Condition: only standard pytorch script from scratch. No use of pretrained models, ensembles, etc.
    * Data: [Cat and Dog](https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog) dataset from Kaggle.
